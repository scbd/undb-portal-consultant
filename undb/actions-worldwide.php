	<h1>Actions around the world</h1>
	<p>
		Safeguarding biodiversity is a task that calls for the active involvement of all citizens, businesses, governments and organizations. Collectively, we need to build a vast network to communicate the importance of biodiversity with the rest of world. Very substantial changes from business-as-usual trends are needed in order to address the challenges we face: to slow and stop the loss of biodiversity.
