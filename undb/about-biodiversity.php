        <h3>What is Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>
        	Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. It includes all organisms, species and populations; the genetic variation among them; and their complex assemblages of communities and ecosystems. The biodiversity we see today consists of millions of distinct biological species, the product of four billion years of evolution. Biodiversity forms the web of life of which we are an integral part and upon which we depend.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Diversity is often understood in terms of the wide variety of plants, animals and microorganisms. Approximately 1.75 million species have been identified; mostly small creatures such as insects. Many scientists, however, believe that there are actually about 13 million species, though estimates range from three to 100 million. Biodiversity also includes genetic differences within each species - for example, between varieties of crops and breeds of livestock. Chromosomes, genes, and DNA—the building blocks of life—determine the uniqueness of each individual and each species.

        </p>
        <h3>Diversity of Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>
        	Another aspect of biodiversity is the variety of ecosystems, such as those that can be found in deserts, forests, wetlands, mountains, lakes, rivers, agricultural landscapes, oceans and coasts. In each ecosystem, living creatures, including humans, form a community, interacting with one another and with the air, water and soil that surround them. It is this combination of life forms and their interactions with each other, and with the rest of the environment, that has made Earth a uniquely habitable place for humans.
        </p>


        <h3>The Value of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services</h3>
        <h4>Solutions to Societal Challenges</h4>
        <p>
					Protecting biodiversity is in our own self-interest, as the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity can provide solutions to a range of societal challenges. Biodiversity provides ecosystem goods and services that benefit humans and sustain our lives. Ecosystem services are essential for human well-being in providing food, water, energy and other benefits. ¬These services all depend on the ecological processes of functioning ecosystems which are underpinned by biodiversity.
					The benefits of biodiversity have been the foundation of the well-being of all past human civilizations, while the  degradation of ecosystems and depletion of natural resources have been root causes for the collapse of past civilizations.  Today, biodiversity continues to underpin our wealth, health and well-being.  
					"Goods and Services" provided by ecosystems include:        	
        </p>
        <p>
					Provision of food, fuel and fibre
					Provision of shelter and building materials
					Purification of air and water
					Detoxification and decomposition of wastes
					Stabilization and moderation of the Earth's climate
					Moderation of floods, droughts, temperature extremes and the forces of wind
					Generation and renewal of soil fertility, including nutrient cycling
					Pollination of plants, including many crops
					Control of pests and diseases
					Maintenance of genetic resources as key inputs to crop varieties and livestock breeds, medicines and other products
					Cultural and aesthetic benefits
					Ability to adapt to change        	
        </p>
				<h4>Biodiversity is essential for sustainable development; development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. </h4>
				<p>
					Poverty Eradication – Biodiversity is the basis for sustainable livelihoods. Benefits of biodiversity are especially important to poor and vulnerable groups. To many, the goods and services derived from biodiversity directly constitute social safety nets and can mean the difference between misery and well-being. 
					Water Security – Clean and secure supplies of water also depend on biodiversity. Ecosystems function as natural water infrastructure, costing less than technological solutions. Forests protect water supplies, wetlands regulate floods, and healthy soils increase water and nutrient availability for crops and help reduce off-farm impacts.
					Food Security – Food production depends on biodiversity and the services provided by ecosystems. The thousands of different crop varieties and animal breeds are founded in the rich genetic pool of species. Biodiversity is also the basis for soil fertility, pollination, pest control and all aspects of food production. 
					Human Health – Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning provide goods and services essential for human health – including nutrients, clean air and water, and regulation of pests and vector-based diseases. Biodiversity is essential for the regulation of the immune response. Biodiversity is the basis of traditional medicine, and a large number of top-ranking global prescription drugs contain components derived from plant extracts.
					Gender Equality – Biodiversity is the cornerstone of the work, belief systems and basic survival of many women. Accounting for women’s knowledge and role in biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use can ensure their full participation and thus substantially contribute to sustainable development.
					Traditional Knowledge associated with biodiversity is also important and has value not only to those who depend on it in their daily lives but to modern industry and agriculture as well.
					Climate Change Mitigation – Biodiversity plays a major role in mitigating climate change by contributing to long-term sequestration of carbon in a number of biomes. Biodiversity also underpins ecosystem resilience and plays a critical role as part of disaster risk reduction and peace-building strategies. Forests, wetlands and mangroves play a critical role in reducing the impacts of extreme events such as droughts, floods and tsunamis.
					Economic Development – Biodiversity is a vital asset in global and local economies.  It directly supports major economic activity and jobs in such diverse sectors as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, cosmetics, horticulture, construction and biotechnology.
					Cities – Even the built environments of our cities are linked to and affected by biodiversity. Ecosystem-based solutions to water provisioning and to urban water run-off, climate control and other challenges can both protect biodiversity and be cost-effective. Green areas in cities help reduce the incidence of violence, enhance human health and well-being and strengthen communities.

				<h4>Facts & Figures</h4>
				<p>
					A network of marine protected areas, with the aim of conserving 20-30 per cent of the seas and oceans, could cost between US$5 billion and US$19 billion, but help to safeguard US$70 billion to US$80 billion worth of fish catches, and the provision of marine ecosystem services valued at US$4.5 trillion to US$6.7 trillion annually.
				</p>
				<p>
					The annual economic median value of fisheries supported by mangrove habitats in the Gulf of California has been estimated at US$37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe. The value of mangroves as coastal protection may be as much as US$300,000 per kilometre of coastline.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nature-based tourism in Africa generates approximately the same amount of revenue as farming, forestry and fisheries combined.
				</p>
				<p>
					The national parks of Canada store 4.43 gigatonnes (billion metric tonnes) of carbon, a service worth between US$11 billion and US$2.2 trillion depending on the price of carbon in the market. The protected areas of Mexico store 2.45 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent – more than five years of Mexico’s carbon dioxide emissions in 2004, and valued at US$12.2 billion.					
				</p>
				<p>
					A report in 2003 estimated the total value of annual benefits of the United Kingdom’s forests to its people to be around £1 billion. They included recreation (£393 million), biodiversity (£386 million), landscape (£150 million) and carbon sequestration (£94 million). The estimate, carried out by Britain’s Forestry Commission, did not include values such as the contribution of forests to the supply and quality of fresh water, the cleansing of pollutants from the air and reduction of soil erosion.					
				</p>
				<p>
					The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is estimated to contribute nearly A$6 billion to the country’s economy, counting only the value of tourism, other recreational activities and commercial fishing.
