	<h1>Biodiversity Champions</h1>

	<h3>Become a Biodiversity Champion by pledging support to achieve Aichi Biodiversity Targets!</h3>
	<p>
		Launched during the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (<a href="">COP 11</a>), the <a href="">Hyderabad Call for Biodiversity Champions</a> aims to highlight Parties' commitment to biodiversity and to encourage all stakeholders to commit resources towards biodiversity in the spirit of <a href="">decision XI/4</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		India became the first Biodiversity Champion during the COP 11 High-level Segment, when India’s Prime Minister announced the earmarking of US$50 million towards strengthening institutional mechanisms, enhancing technical and human capabilities for biodiversity conservation in India, and promoting similar capacity building in other developing countries during India's COP Presidency.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Champions campaign seeks to highlight truly inventive, creative and exceptional examples of support to the <a href="">Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020</a>. Its potential strength comes from the unique and memorable nature of the pledges, and the commitments to implementation that they bring. 
	</p>
